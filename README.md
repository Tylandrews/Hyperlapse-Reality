Hyperlapse Reality
Mixed Reality (VR) Hyperlapse Photography
Project Overview

Hyperlapse reality at its core concept bridges the reality of hyperlapse photography (in the real world) and virtually built cities namely Wellington City, NZ. Having a vast collection of Hyperlases of Wellington I want to create an experience that lets the viewer move through a virtual space in time while still having the connected real city reality from the photography. GIS data that somewhat accurately constructs a virtual Wellington city via data visualisation in 3D rendering software allows me to place these elements together to create such an experience.

Hyperlapse or moving time-lapse (also stop-motion time-lapse) is a technique in for creating motion shots. In its simplest form, a hyperlapse is achieved by moving the camera a short distance between each shot.




Breaking down a bit of my research of hyper realities and the new aesthetic, in a realistic view of my photography work, I want to bring a new wonder to the expression in my work. This notion that the New aesthetic is technology talking back to us as we constantly innovate and visualise the future –I want to explore the visual dynamic connection Hyperlapse photography has on location and time. Hyper reality can be explained as an inability to distinguish reality from a simulation and in today’s world AR, MR and HR are becoming widely adopted in mobile technologies we have in our pockets.


For this project I propose a new way of seeing the city around us. This becomes more and more important as the restrictions of Covid-19 pose complications of being able to be in cities around others. Hyperlapse Lives in this very linear and expressive type of industry, music videos, Tv show B-roll sequences and advertising. I want to expand on this visual storytelling medium in a way that gives the user a sense of time, Geo-location and aesthetic emotion. Hyper realities – hyperlapse reality.

“A focus on embodied interaction moves from the 2nd paradigm idea that thinking is cognitive, abstract, and information-based to one where thinking is also achieved through doing things in the world, for example expression through gestures, learning through manipulation, or thinking through building prototypes. Hyperlapse reality looks to bridge the embodied interaction with photography, where in some sense you may know where you are and through the manipulation of the application you’ll get a sense of location and time(through visual expression via the photography)

“The 3rd paradigm, in contrast, sees meaning and meaning construction as a central focus.”
